# ProjectU Simple clean NodeJS API

A simple clean REST API built with NodeJS, express with a n-tier architecture (organized into layers). My Udemy course explaining how to build it is available at: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-backend-api-node-js-and-react-frontend/learn/lecture/33130370#overview


## Setting Up

- Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v14 or newer innstalled.
- Run `npm ci` to install all dependencies.
- `npm start` to start your API on port `4000`.
  - You can change the port by editing `src/server.js` and changing `const port = 4000;` to another port number.
- Download [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to send easily HTTP requests to your API.
  - In this Udemy course, I will be using Insomnia v4.2, so Insomnia would be the recommended one.


## Running unit tests

```console
npm test
```

Or with `npx`

```console
npx ava
```

## Running it with Podman

1. Make sure Podman is correctly installed on your machine - https://podman.io/getting-started/installation
2. From a command line opened , run `podman machine init`, and then `podman machine start`
3. Then, in the project folder (still from your terminal), let's build the image with `podman build -t simple-api-image .`
4. Once it has finished and the image successfully built, you should be able to see it by typing `podman images`
5. Finally, let's run the image container by typing `podman run -p 4000:4000 simple-api-image` - Here, we use port `4000`, and map it to the local port `4000`.


## 3rd-party libraries
To make our job easier, this API uses the some great handy libraries such as...

* [Pino logging library](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)
* [Yup schema validation](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
* [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit)
